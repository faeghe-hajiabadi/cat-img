# Random Cat Image Viewer üê±

This is a simple React application that fetches and displays random cat images using [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/). The app is designed to demonstrate how to use React's context API to manage and share state across components.

## Features

- Fetches and displays a random cat image.
- Allows users to load a new random cat image by clicking a button.
- Manages image data and state using React Context API.
- Provides basic error handling if the image fetch fails.


## Getting Started

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server:**
